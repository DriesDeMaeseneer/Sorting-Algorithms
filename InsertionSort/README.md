#Insertion Sort

Wikipedia definition:
- Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Advantages:
- Simple implementation
- Efficient for (quite) small data sets
- Online: can sort a list as it receives it
